            <h2>What is Geophysics?</h2>
            <p>Geophysics is the interdisciplinary scientific field that involves the study of the physical properties of the Earth and other celestial bodies. It combines principles from physics, mathematics, and geology to understand the internal structure, composition, and dynamics of the Earth. Geophysicists use a variety of methods to gather data and analyze Earth's subsurface, helping us uncover valuable insights about our planet's history and processes.</p>

            <h2>Geophysical Methods</h2>
            <p>Geophysicists employ a range of methods to explore the Earth's interior and its surrounding environment. These methods include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Seismic Surveys: By analyzing the propagation of seismic waves through the Earth, geophysicists can create detailed images of subsurface structures. This technique is crucial for understanding tectonic plate movements, earthquake hazards, and oil and gas reservoirs.</li>
                <li>Magnetic Surveys: Geophysicists measure variations in the Earth's magnetic field to identify subsurface rock formations and geological structures. This method is helpful in locating mineral deposits and mapping geological features.</li>
                <li>Gravity Surveys: By measuring gravitational anomalies, geophysicists can infer the distribution of mass within the Earth. This helps in mapping variations in subsurface density and identifying features like underground caverns and lava tubes.</li>
            </ul>
